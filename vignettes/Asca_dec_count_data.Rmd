## Introduction

To illustrate the use of gASCA in the analysis of count data we will
consider a synthetic dataset which is available as a part of the package
installation. This vignette will be also used to show how to use
gg-style plotting to visualize the results of the gASCA analyses

## The dataset

The synthetic dataset was simulated to mimic the results of a
hypothetical experiment where the abundance of 15 species is measured
over time across different treatments, with the following design:

-   15 count variables (e.g. species, identified as `s1 .. s15`)
-   2 factor design (5 time points, 3 treatments)
-   10 replicates

The example dataset was designed to have two latent variables (LV) for
the time factor and one for the treatment.

Considering the 15 variables:

-   The first four are responsive to the time factor. `s1` and `s2`
    mirrors LV1, `s3` and `s4` are linked to LV2.
-   `s5` and `s6` are affected by the treatment factor.
-   `s7` and `s10` are also sensitive to the two LVs of the interaction.
    In other words, for them the effect of treatment depends on time.
-   The remaining variables contain only noise.

The dataset is included in the package as a two element list containing
the count matrix `synth_count_data$counts` and a data frame holding the
association between the 150 samples and the design factors
(`synth_count_data$design`).

A detailed description of how the synthetic dataset was simulated is
included in one of the package vignettes.

``` r
## load the libraries
library(gASCA)

## load the dataset
data("synth_count_data")

## show a compact representation of the structure of the dataset
str(synth_count_data)
```

    ## List of 2
    ##  $ counts: int [1:150, 1:15] 0 1 4 2 1 2 2 0 1 1 ...
    ##   ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
    ##   .. ..$ : NULL
    ##   .. ..$ : chr [1:15] "s1" "s2" "s3" "s4" ...
    ##  $ design:'data.frame':  150 obs. of  2 variables:
    ##   ..$ time     : chr [1:150] "t0" "t0" "t0" "t0" ...
    ##   ..$ treatment: chr [1:150] "B1" "B1" "B1" "B1" ...

In this synthetic dataset we are dealing with a design with 5 time
points and three treatments

``` r
## time
unique(synth_count_data$design$time)
```

    ## [1] "t0" "t1" "t2" "t3" "t4"

``` r
## time
unique(synth_count_data$design$treatment)
```

    ## [1] "B1" "B2" "B3"

The following plot shows the distribution of the counts for variable
`s1` as a function of the design factors

``` r
data_df <- cbind.data.frame(synth_count_data$design,synth_count_data$counts)

stripchart(s1 ~ time, data = data_df[data_df$treatment =="B1",], vertical = TRUE, pch = 1, method = "jitter", 
           col = "orange", main = "S1", ylab = "Counts")
stripchart(s1 ~ time, data = data_df[data_df$treatment =="B2",], vertical = TRUE, pch = 1, method = "jitter", col = "steelblue", add = TRUE)
stripchart(s1 ~ time, data = data_df[data_df$treatment =="B3",], vertical = TRUE, pch = 1, method = "jitter", col = "red", add = TRUE)
legend("topleft", legend=c("Treat B1", "Treat B2", "Treat B3"),
       col=c("orange","steelblue","red"), lty = 1, bty = "n")
```

The effect of time on this variable is clear.

## Performing the decomposition

The function which performs the gASCA decomposition is `ASCA_decompose`
and its results are organized in a list. To run the function it is
necessary to provide:

-   a `matrix` or a `data.frame` with the counts;
-   a `data.frame` with the association between the samples and the
    design. Beware that numeric columns will results in a decomposition
    error!
-   a formula (actually a character vector) which specify the form of
    the decomposition;
-   a `list` with the parameters which will be passed to the `glm` call;
-   a character vector specifying the type of errors which will be
    returned by `glm`;

The synthetic data consists of counts so the natural choice is to run a
Poisson glm. The formula specifies a 3 term decomposition accounting for
the effects of `time`, `treatment` and their interaction. Within
`ASCA-decompose` the formula has to be specified following the standard
`glm` syntax.

``` r
## perform the decomposition
asca0 <- ASCA_decompose(
  d = synth_count_data$design,
  x = synth_count_data$counts, 
  f = "time + treatment + time:treatment",
  glm_par = list(family = poisson()))
```

Let’s give a look to the structure of the `asca0` object

``` r
str(asca0)
```

For a detailed description of the elements of the list the reader could
refer to the documentation. The main output of the function is a list
which holds the result of the decomposition (`asca0$decomposition`).
Each element of this list is a matrix containing the expected values
estimated by the glm model of the individual variables. Each
decomposition matrix holds samples as rows and variables as columns.
Among the other terms of the output we would like to highlight:

*`pseudoR2`: a vector holding the pseudo *R*<sup>2</sup> of the
individual univariate models, which can be used to assess the level of
fit of the proposed decomposition on each individual variable;
*`varimp`: a matrix holding the importance of each variable for the
different decomposition terms. The variable importance is defined as the
norm of the vector composed by the estimated expected values. It is
important to point out that this type of variable importance can be
biased in presence of log link functions and for variables showing large
fraction of zeroes; \*`terms_L2`: a vector holding the Frobenius norm of
the decomposition matrices.

$$
\lVert Y \rVert\_{Frobenius} = \sqrt{\sum\_{ij} \lvert y\_{ij} \rvert^2} 
$$

The L2-norm and the `varimp` can be used to compare the importance of
the different variables and decomposition terms. Due to the
characteristics of the matrix norm, this measure of importance is also
biased for non gaussian link functions and large fraction of zeroes.

For a detailed description of the individual elements of the
decomposition list the user can refer to the package documentation.

## Validation

In terms of matrix algebra, the ASCA decomposition of a matrix *X* can
be interpreted as a data model

*Y* = *Y*<sub>*A*</sub> + *Y*<sub>*B*</sub> + *Y*<sub>*C*</sub> + ... + *E*

The significance of this decomposition can then be assessed by
constructing an empirical null distribution of the norms of each term by
repeatedly (and independently) permuting the design labels. The
rationale behind this idea is to assess how likely is to obtain the
observed norms only by chance. Permutation can be applied both to the
L2-norm of the individual terms and to the estimates of variable
importance. Unfortunately, as already discussed, in the case of count
data, this type of approach may be biased in presence of a large
fraction of zeroes. As a partial alternative, here we propose to use the
same strategy to used assess the responsiveness of the individual
variables to the model in terms of pseudo *R*<sup>2</sup>, defined as

*R*<sub>*p**s**e**u**d**o*</sub><sup>2</sup> = 1 − *d**e**v**i**a**n**c**e*\_*r**e**s**i**d**u**a**l*/*d**e**v**i**a**n**c**e*\_*n**u**l**l*

As for the conventional *R*<sup>2</sup>, values closer to 1 indicate a
better fit. Conversely, values closer to 0 are obtained if the residual
deviance of the model is comparable with the deviance of the null model
and this is the indication that the proposed model is not a clear
improvement in comparison to the null model.

The idea is to identify which variables are significantly affected by
the design and then to limit the multivariate decomposition to them.

In the `gASCA` package the permutation based approach is provided by the
`ASCA_permutation` function, which requires as input the results of
`ASCA_decompose`, the number of independent permutations (100 by
default) and the empirical quantile used to judge the significance (0.95
by default).

Let’s now run the validation

The `asca0_validation` holds the quantiles of the empirical null
distribution obtained by permutation. The following plot shows the
results of the significance test of the L2-norm of the individual terms.

``` r
barplot(asca0$terms_L2, col = "steelblue", main = "Term L2 norm", border = NA)
barplot(asca0_validation$L2_qt, col = "#8f1402", border = NA, add = TRUE)
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

The red rectangle indicate the 95 percentile of the null distribution of
the norm for each term. In this case the decomposition turns out to be
significant for all terms, and all three design factors show a
comparable relevance in the decomposition.

In terms of the variable importance for the three factors, instead:

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
barplot(asca0$varimp[,1], col = "steelblue", main = "Variable importance: time", border = NA)
barplot(asca0_validation$varimp_qt[,1], col = "#8f1402", border = NA, add = TRUE)
barplot(asca0$varimp[,2], col = "steelblue", main = "Variable importance: treatment", border = NA)
barplot(asca0_validation$varimp_qt[,2], col = "#8f1402", border = NA, add = TRUE)
barplot(asca0$varimp[,3], col = "steelblue", main = "Variable importance: time:treatment", border = NA)
barplot(asca0_validation$varimp_qt[,3], col = "#8f1402", border = NA, add = TRUE)
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

As before, the red bars indicate the empirical quantile of the variable
importance upon permutation of the design. The picture we get with this
analysis is in line with the characteristics of the simulated dataset:
only the first four species are significantly responding to the *time*
factor; s5 and s6, instead are important for *treatment* and s7 .. s10
for the *interaction*.

The following plot shows the result of the model fit assessment in terms
of pseudo *R*<sup>2</sup>:

``` r
barplot(asca0$pseudoR2, col = "steelblue", main = "Univariate model fit", border = NA, ylab = "pseudo R2", ylim = c(0,1))
barplot(asca0_validation$R2_qt, col = "#8f1402", border = NA, add = TRUE)
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

Also here the results are coherent with the design of the synthetic
dataset: the first 10 variables shows a significant
pseudo-*R*<sup>2</sup> and this is not only indicating that they are
significantly responding to the design, but also that the proposed model
is capturing a large fraction of the data variability. It is also
interesting to observe that, not unexpectedly, the univariate null
quantiles are similar for all the 10 variables.

As already discussed, the previous results can be used to restrict the
analysis to the responsive variables. In the `gASCA` package the
decomposition can be trimmed by using the `ASCA_trim_vars()` function:

``` r
focus_dec <- ASCA_trim_vars(asca0$decomposition, keep = 1:10)
```

## Analysis of the decomposition terms

### Eigenvectors and Multivariate Decomposition

#### Time

Let’s now focus on the three decomposition matrices in terms of their
multivariate latent factors. Depending on the term, these LV can be
interpreted as “eigentrends” (for time) or “eigentreatments” (for
treatment) and they are actually what we would like to interpret.
Remember that the rank of the matrix associated to each factor is
determined by the number of levels of each factor because the
decomposition matrices are constructed with the model expected values.
The number of LVs will be then equal to the number of factors minus one.

As an example, this is the set of predicted values for the time factor
of variable `s1`

``` r
plot(asca0$decomposition$time[,"s1"], ylab = "I", xlab = "Sample Index", pch = 19, col = "steelblue")
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

The presence of a limited number of constant values is coherent with the
levels of the time factor, while the scale on the y axis shows that
predictions are performed in the linear predictor space. Since the
*time* factor has 5 levels the rank of the matrix will be four. We then
expect four eigentrends. Their relative importance is proportional to
the individual eigenvalues.

The SVD decomposition of the ASCA array is performed by the `ASCA_svd`
function.

``` r
asca0_svd <- ASCA_svd(focus_dec)
```

Also here the result is a list with each element holding the results of
the svd of the single decomposition terms performed by using the
`prcomp` function of base R. As in a usual PCA analysis, the amount of
explained variability (square of the standard deviation) can be used to
identify how many eigentrends are needed to present an informative
representation of the overall matrix. This type of representation is
known as *scree plot*.

Let’s first consider the *time* factor. The following screeplot can be
used to identify the number of relevant eigentrends:

``` r
plot(asca0_svd$time, col = "#4682b490", main = "Screeplot: time", npcs = 4)
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

Apparently two LVs are able to capture the global structure of the data.
Let’s visualize the two eigentrends

``` r
## reduce to a set of individual values compensating for potential numeric inaccuracies
eigentrends <- unique(cbind.data.frame(time = synth_count_data$design$time,
                                       LV1 = round(asca0_svd$time$x[,"PC1"],2),
                                       LV2 = round(asca0_svd$time$x[,"PC2"],2)))

eigentrends
```

    ##     time   LV1   LV2
    ## 1     t0 -2.05  0.99
    ## 31    t1 -1.02 -0.52
    ## 61    t2  0.03 -1.01
    ## 91    t3  1.07 -0.49
    ## 121   t4  1.97  1.03

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(LV1~ seq_along(LV1), data = eigentrends, 
     xaxt = 'n', type = "b", col = "steelblue", pch = 19, xlab = "time", cex = 1, main = "Eigentrend #1")
axis(1, at=seq_along(eigentrends$LV1), labels=eigentrends$time)
plot(LV2~ seq_along(LV2), data = eigentrends, 
     xaxt = 'n', type = "b", col = "orange", pch = 19, xlab = "time", cex = 1, main = "Eigentrend #2")
axis(1, at=seq_along(eigentrends$LV2), labels=eigentrends$time)
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

As expected, the first eigentrend is characterized by a steady increase
which contrasts with the pattern of the second LV with a “U” shaped
profile. In the synthetic data the actual trend of LV2 for the time
factor is opposite, but this simply results from the sign
indetermination of PCA. The loadings will tell which variables are
mainly associated to them.

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
barplot(asca0_svd$time$rotation[,1], col = "steelblue", main = "Loadingsplot: eigentrend #1")
barplot(asca0_svd$time$rotation[,2], col = "orange", main = "Loadingsplot: eigentrend #2")
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->
In keeping with the characteristics of the synthetic data, s1 and s2 are
contributing strongly to the increasing eigentrend, while s3 and s4
mainly characterize the second LV. Also the intensity of the loadings
correctly reflects the values used in the generation of the synthetic
dataset. Further supporting the coherence of these results, below we
show the real time trends of the measured values for s1 and s3:

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
stripchart(s1 ~ time, data = data_df, vertical = TRUE, pch = 1, method = "jitter", 
           col = "steelblue", main = "S1", ylab = "Counts")
stripchart(s3 ~ time, data = data_df, vertical = TRUE, pch = 1, method = "jitter", 
           col = "orange", main = "S3", ylab = "Counts")
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Treatment

The treatment factor has 3 levels so a maximum of 2 LVs is expected to
be relevant. As before, the screeplot will highlight the individual
contribution of the two eigentreatments

``` r
plot(asca0_svd$treatment, col = "#4682b490", main = "Screeplot: treatment", npcs = 2)
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

Nonetheless, as expected, only one LV is relevant here. In the following
plot the profile of the eigentreatment and its loadings are shown:

``` r
## reduce to a set of individual values compensating for potential numeric inaccuracies
eigentreatments <- unique(cbind.data.frame(treatment = synth_count_data$design$treatment,
                                       LV1 = round(asca0_svd$treatment$x[,"PC1"],2)))

eigentreatments

As before, this is perfectly in line with the characteristics of the
synthetic dataset.

#### Interaction

The last element of the decomposition is the interaction. Here the
number of possible LVs is large, let’s start with the screeplot

``` r
plot(asca0_svd$`time:treatment`, col = "#4682b490", main = "Screeplot: interaction")
```

Here, 2 components are able to capture almost all the variance, with the
first eigenvector showing a prominent role. Let’s look to the shape of
the two components:

``` r
## reduce to a set of individual values compensating for potential numeric inaccuracies
eigentrends_int <- unique(cbind.data.frame(time = synth_count_data$design$time,
                                           treatment = synth_count_data$design$treatment,
                                       LV1 = round(asca0_svd$`time:treatment`$x[,"PC1"],2),
                                       LV2 = round(asca0_svd$`time:treatment`$x[,"PC2"],2)))

eigentrends_int
```

    ##     time treatment   LV1   LV2
    ## 1     t0        B1 -1.16  0.21

    ## 51    t1        B3  1.21 -0.16
    ## 61    t2        B1  0.62  0.16
    ## 71    t2        B2  0.58 -0.39
    ## 81    t2        B3 -1.20  0.24
    ## 91    t3        B1  1.17 -0.16
    ## 101   t3        B2  1.21  0.30
    ## 111   t3        B3 -2.38 -0.13
    ## 121   t4        B1 -0.02 -0.03
    ## 131   t4        B2 -0.03  0.04
    ## 141   t4        B3  0.05 -0.01

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

with(eigentrends_int[eigentrends_int$treatment == "B1",], plot(LV1 ~ as.numeric(factor(time)), 
     xaxt = 'n', type = "b", col = "orange", pch = 19, xlab = "time", cex = 1, main = "Eigentrend #1", ylim = c(-2.5,2.5)))
with(eigentrends_int[eigentrends_int$treatment == "B2",], lines(LV1 ~ as.numeric(factor(time)),
                                                  type = "b", col = "steelblue", pch = 19, xlab = "time", cex = 1))
with(eigentrends_int[eigentrends_int$treatment == "B3",], lines(LV1 ~ as.numeric(factor(time)),

axis(1, at=as.numeric(factor(unique(eigentrends_int$time))), labels=levels(factor(eigentrends_int$time)))




with(eigentrends_int[eigentrends_int$treatment == "B1",], plot(LV2 ~ as.numeric(factor(time)), 
     xaxt = 'n', type = "b", col = "orange", pch = 19, xlab = "time", cex = 1, main = "Eigentrend #2", ylim = c(-1.5,1.5)))
with(eigentrends_int[eigentrends_int$treatment == "B2",], lines(LV2 ~ as.numeric(factor(time)),
                                                  type = "b", col = "steelblue", pch = 19, xlab = "time", cex = 1))
with(eigentrends_int[eigentrends_int$treatment == "B3",], lines(LV2 ~ as.numeric(factor(time)),
                                                  type = "b", col = "red", pch = 19, xlab = "time", cex = 1))
axis(1, at=as.numeric(factor(unique(eigentrends_int$time))), labels=levels(factor(eigentrends_int$time)))

legend("bottomright", legend=c("Treat B1", "Treat B2", "Treat B3"),
       col=c("orange","steelblue","red"), lty = 1, bty = "n", cex = 0.8)
```

Also in this case, results are in line with the characteristics of the
synthetic data. The larger eigentrend shows a different temporal trend
of B3 in comparison to the other two treatments. LV2, instead,
differentiates B2 from B1 and B3. Interestingly, both the magnitude of
the scores and the variable importance indicate that the first
eigentrend has a larger impact on the structure of the data. In terms of
loadings:

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
barplot(asca0_svd$`time:treatment`$rotation[,1], col = "steelblue", main = "Loadingsplot: eigentrend #1")
barplot(asca0_svd$`time:treatment`$rotation[,2], col = "orange", main = "Loadingsplot: eigentrend #2")
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)<!-- -->

The reconstruction follows the structure of the data, with the exception
being the direction (sign) of the effect, due to the sign
indetermination of PCA.

### Combining terms

The function `ASCA_combine_terms` allows the combination of different
factor matrices. The function accepts as input the output of
`ASCA_decomposition` and a character vector specifying which terms
should be combined.

``` r
## combine two terms
asca0_comb <- ASCA_combine_terms(asca0, c("time","time:treatment"))


## perform the svd of the combined decomposition removing unresponsive variables
asca0_comb_svd <- ASCA_svd(ASCA_trim_vars(asca0_comb$decomposition, keep = 1:10))
```

Let’s now focus on the LVs of the combined terms.

``` r
## here we use the base scree plot
plot(asca0_comb_svd$`time+time:treatment`, main = "time + time:treatment", col = "steelblue")
```

![](/home/franceschp/Projects/gASCA/vignettes/src/Asca_dec_count_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)<!-- -->

The screeplot shows that the structure of the combined term is well
characterized by three latent variables which are shown in the following
plot:

``` r
## reduce to a set of individual values compensating for potential numeric inaccuracies
eigencomb <- unique(cbind.data.frame(synth_count_data$design,
                                       LV1 = round(asca0_comb_svd$`time+time:treatment`$x[,"PC1"],2),
                                       LV2 = round(asca0_comb_svd$`time+time:treatment`$x[,"PC2"],2),
                                       LV3 = round(asca0_comb_svd$`time+time:treatment`$x[,"PC3"],2)))

coherently with what was observed for the *time* factor, the first LV of
the combined decomposition shows a steady increase which is now
modulated by treatment B3 in the interaction term. The inspection of the
loadings supports this interpretation, s1 and s2 are indeed - by
design - the species showing an increase over time. s7 and s8 are also
partially contributing to this trend and their contribution
differentiates B3 from B1 and B2. LV2 turns out to be similar to LV1 of
the interaction term discussed previously. Similarly, s7 and s8 are the
most influential variables, but now a residual contribution of s1 and s2
is also visible, which accounts for the slight overall time trend
visible in the three treatment traces. The last LV is mirroring the
trend visible in the LV2 of the *time* factor, this is clearly confirmed
from the loadings plot.
