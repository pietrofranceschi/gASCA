\usage{
ASCA_svd(arr)
}
\arguments{
\item{arr}{the multidimensional (2D or 3D) array. In 2D case rows are samples and columns variables. 
In the 3D case (the output of `ASCA_decompose`) organized as samples x terms x variables 
the SVD is performed along the 2nd dimension, aka one SVD per term.
If the matrix has rank 1 the decompoition is set to NULL}
}
\value{
a list with the results of the SVD decomposition. 
 * scores: a list with the scores for each term, in the linear predictor space
 * loadings: a list with the scores for each term
 * varimp: a list with the importance of each variable for each term
 * variances: a list with the variance of each eigenvector for each term
